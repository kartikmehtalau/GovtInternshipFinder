### Introduction
The Internship Recommender is an intelligent AI-driven platform designed to provide personalized internship opportunities, especially for candidates with limited digital exposure. Instead of overwhelming users with a long and confusing list, it simplifies the process by suggesting the top three to five internships that best match their profile. The system takes into account education, skills, interests, and location to ensure relevant and practical recommendations.

A unique feature of the platform is its Skill Strength Indicator, which categorizes abilities as Good or Excellent, motivating users to improve their profiles and enhance employability. With its simple, mobile-friendly interface and support for regional languages, the Internship Recommender ensures accessibility and ease of use for a wide range of candidates.
